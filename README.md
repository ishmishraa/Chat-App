# Chat-App

A real chat application using nodeJs ExpressJs and socket.io as it will be impossible to put in place a real-time system of sending/receiving data with a relational database and Ajax calls. That's why we used WebSocket and the library socket.io to build this chat application.

It is tested using Mocha-a Javascript testing framework.

In this project a user can join any room and chat to all the members present in that room and can send location  which will be shown on google map by using Geolocation API.
